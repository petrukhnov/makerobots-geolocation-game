## Structure screen

Similar to "fallout shelter" / "terraria" base view. Content depends on player gps location. May not be available, if no buildings nearby.

Each new room level cost more in exponential scale. It is possible to build underground rooms and overground.

E.g. 2 structures could be connected with pipes.
