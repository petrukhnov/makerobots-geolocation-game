# Gameplay (outdated)

## Gameplay example

### Early gameplay (first month)

Make a team.

Collect resources manually

Build simple buildings to start research and start collecting things automatically.

Build launch pad.

Build rocket.

Launch rocket with satellite to get points. (~2 weeks to launch first rocket)

Points will contribute to player/team/agency score. This score is used to improve teams/alliances.


### Mid gameplay (first year)

Build antenna arrays to send rockets to specific locations, bringing more points and boosting research. Connected antenna array contain of 3 antennas, that form triangle. Triangle area and perimeter defines where rocket could be send (bigger-> better). 5-50km antenna arrays.
Automate resource collection.

Improve resource conversion (productivity).

Join agency.

Send rockets with robots.

### Late gameplay (1-5th year).

Build agency structures to send rockets even further away. E.g. antenna array 1K-10M km2

Even more research and productivity.

Develop agency to include more teams (3->50).

## Gameplay detailed

### When game loaded

When player start game he is exposed to shoer story message.

You were hired to help humanity with space exploration. Your mission is to build rockets and send them to nearest stars. Invented engines allow to us to send small payloads to nearest stars in just few days.

To start you will have to build launchpad and some production failities.

(OK)


### Team

Show message. Create and choose name for your team.

Team name is 30 characters. Doesn't have to be unique. # with 4 numbers will be added. E.g. "My Super Team"#4321.

Knowledge collector cost 10(quanta)/3(knowledge). Bring 5 knowledge from nerby resources per day.

Cost multiplier: every next room costs 2x resources.

Build research lab 50/5 (quanta/knowledge).

Deposit resources to lab, so it start researching something.

Available research:

Pipes 3/15: allow connect structures and transfer resources. Allows to build outer pipes and pump. Pipe cost: 10/1 per 10metres. Pump cost 25/3.

Scanner 1/5: reveal quanta every X hours. Scanner cost 15/2

Converter 1/5: convert 100 quanta to 1 knowledge. Knowlege get copy of one that already exist in teams resources. Converter cost 100/5.
